    <p>
        My lifestyle has not been good these past few days. Physically it is not good and mentally it is not good.

        I will do a presentation in the gauge theory seminar at Wathematica. I could not make a enough time to prepare for it since there are several tasks arising on Monday and Tuesday. One of my senior colleagues has been ill recently, and I was asked to do his work instead.

        I decided to start a diary to improve my English skills. I think this is very hard work until I get used to it.
        Yesterday, I took the TOEFL iBT test at my home and it was terribly bad. So I decided to do this. I'm so busy
        these days that I can't upload this too much, I guess. I will write as much as I can.<br>

        I will write my goals to clarify what the purpose is.

        10:42 p.m.<br>
        I have been extremely busy recently, taking on additional responsibilities such as giving seminars in the laboratory and at the circle club, as well as carrying out some routine tasks. I should have declined the offer before accepting it. I am aware that it is better to say no than to not complete the business and to make a lot of trouble for others.

        I lost my motivation for study theses days. I'm not sure but it may have something to do with the low pressure caused by the typhoon.

        I suddenly remembered that some people talk about topics that I have a hard time responding to. I wish they would stop it.

        I drove with my friends from Thursday night to Friday morning, through the whole night. I enjoyed it pretty much, but it was too hard for me, so that I can't study yet. I'm also suffering from summer fatigue. I think I should take vegetable a lot.

        I found some interesting YouTube channels, related to the NBA and news in the USA. I immediately subscribed to them. They are fun so far. I want to continue watching but I have to withdraw the money from our accounts, otherwise I will make some trouble for others on the trip tomorrow.

        I deleted the manga viewer from my phone. There is a lot of content around me that makes me happy, and I waste
        countless hours enjoying it. I understand that it is like poison or drugs that have the potential of the
        addiction, but I cannot stop it. Removing all the data from my PC or memory is only a temporary solution. I have
        to face it and control my desires.
    </p>

    <p>
        By the way, I read <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Edward+Witten" target="_blank"> the article about
            Edward Witten in nLab</a> and I found the interesting sentence. That is <i>"Despite the deeply theoretical
            and abstract mathematical aspects of his work, Witten has visibly always been motivated by fundamental
            questions in the phenomenology of the standard model of particle physics and cosmology."</i> I have an
        inferiority complex since I failed some exams and because I'm now working in phenomenology, not in theory. But
        then I read this article, I feel saved though it might be an illusion. I should try again and again without
        giving up.

        I did strength training with singing songs. It was a lot of fun for me, though I was a little worried that the
        people in the next room could hear me singing. Anyway, it seems to keep the workout!

        This is my first diary update in a long time. There are a lot of things to write but I don't have a enough time
        to put them here.
        I'm watching "Mr. Bean" which was recommended by my senior colleague. He wanted me to watch it eagerly, but
        unfortunately I don't find it funny.

        My lifestyle has not been good the last few days. Physically it is not good and mentally it is not good. Almost
        everything is caused by the bad use of the mobile phone, maybe. I spend a lot of time reading manga and playing
        games. It also forces me to sleep badly. I should change my daily routine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Until I update this daily, I have decided on several things in my mind. These are as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>Once I have updated your diary, rewrite it in English</li>
        This is important to me since I'm not very good at translating into English. I feel that I cannot rewrite the
        sentences even though I can talk to others since I can manage to change what I say when I talk. However, this is
        not always the case when I translate into English.
        <li>Drink water, avoid eating outside</li>
        This is for my health and economy. I believe professionals are certainly concerned about his health.
        <li>Do not install the unnecessary applications on my mobile phone</li>
        I used to indulge myself, but I have decided to stop it.
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        There were many things I had planned to write about, but when I started writing I forgot them. I heard this is
        because you use your phone too much.

        I will do a presentation in the gauge theory seminar at Wathematica. I could not make a enough time to prepare
        for it since there are several tasks arising on Monday and Tuesday. One of my senior colleagues has been ill
        recently, and I was asked to do his work instead.

    <p>
        I have been extremely busy recently, taking on additional responsibilities such as giving seminars in the
        laboratory and at the circle club, as well as carrying out some routine tasks. I should have declined the offer
        before accepting it. I am aware that it is better to say no than to not complete the business and to make a lot
        of trouble for others.

    <p>
        I decided to start a diary to improve my English skills. I think this is very hard work until I get used to it.
        Yesterday, I took the TOEFL iBT test at my home and it was terribly bad. So I decided to do this. I'm so busy
        these days that I can't upload this too much, I guess. I will write as much as I can.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will write my goals to clarify what the purpose is.

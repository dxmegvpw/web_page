    <h2>My setup for VS Code and LaTeX</h2>

    <p>
        When I write notes or report assignments, I usually use LaTeX since it produces beautifully formatted
        mathematical equations, and above all, it is enjoyable to use.
    </p>

    <p>
        To make our LaTeX lives happier, I usually use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for a text editor. It helps us to
        write TeX code and introduce some features, like Grammarly or git etc., more easily. I cannot imagine my life
        without VS Code for me. In this notes, I will show you one of the installation and setup examples for LaTeX and
        VS Code. Our strategies are as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and VS Code.<br>
            We will use a virtual environment and activate LaTeX on it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Log in to the VS Code account and synchronies the settings. (If you do not have a Microsoft account, you
            should create one as it will be easier to set up next time).<br>
            Install TeX Live on Linux from the command prompt.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>



    <h3>Install the application</h3>

    <p>
        The VS Code installer is available <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank">here</a>.
        Confirm your Operating System and download appropriate versions to your computer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before (or after) installing, you should also install Ubuntu for your computer. Basically, we will be using the
        virtual environment and installing LaTeX (and Python, C++, etc.) on it from now on. You should open the command
        prompt and act "wsl --install Ubuntu". (If wsl command does not work, you have to install WSL and register the
        path on it.) After waiting several minutes, entering the username and password are required. Then you complied
        the installation.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you have finished installing Ubuntu on your PC, let us start the setup for VS Code. Fortunately, we can
        synchronize the settings through the personal account, we can immediately finish several steps like finding the
        working folder, installing the application, etc. In summary, what you need to do at first is wait until the
        synchronization of the settings is finished and restart VS Code again to update the options.
    </p>



    <h3>Setting up the virtual environment and syncing with GitHub</h3>

    <p>
        Here is one of the most complex steps, installing Ubuntu and GitHub on VS Code. As I said, we can skip the
        setting about the VS Code through our account, but we should synchronize these applications on your computer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let me show you the step to use Ubuntu on the VS Code first. It is not so difficult, what you have to do is just
        to register your username and password on the Linux. When your turn on the Ubuntu for the first time, the
        registration form arise and you should follow its instruction. After finishing it, you should check the Remote
        Explorer tab of VS Code. If you successfully download the application "WSL" on the VS Code, you will open the
        workspace on the Linux. However, you will immediately notice that your Linux folder is almost empty. Therefore,
        let us install the GitHub to share the folders! Before installing GitHub, you should create a folder for it. In
        my case, I create the folder "git" under the user folder (e.g. /home/*username*/git). The preparation is done!
    </p>

    <p>
        Now we need to install the git command on Linux. This is not a difficult step as the installer is already
        provided. All we need to do is type "sudo apt-get install git" at the command prompt. After waiting for the
        installation to complete, you can configure the git command. You should configure some information as follows
    <ul>
        <li>
            git config --global user.email "(your email address)"
        </li>
        <li>
            git config --global user.name "(your username)"
        </li>
    </ul>
    This step is required when you commit the repository. Once you have finished configuring, the next step is to clone
    the repository. You should be able to navigate to your github repository and find its URL. If you cannot get the
    URL, go back to the command prompt and run "git clone URL" to create a clone of the repository in your computer.
    That's all you need to do with GitHub.
    <ul>
        Useful tips:
        <li>
            If the commitments are conflicting, there are two solutions. One is to force your commitment. The command is
            "git push -f origin main" (or equivalently "git push --force origin main"). The other way is to adjust the
            current repository. The commands are "git fetch origin main" and "git reset --hard origin/main".
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Installing LaTeX</h3>

    <p>
        You should follow these steps:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Move to the directory where you want to unpack the installer and get it by using <i>wget</i><br>
            "wget http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz"
        </li>
        <li>
            Expand what you obtained and go to the unpacked directory<br>
            "tar xvf install-tl-unx.tar.gz" and "cd install-tl-(date)"
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the installer.<br>
            "sudo ./install-tl -no-gui -repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/"
        </li>
        <li>
            Register the path on your computer<br>
            "sudo /usr/local/texlive/2024/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr path add"<br>
            (I am not sure what command this is. I guess <i>tlmgr</i> enable us to register all command in the bin
            folder.)
        </li>
        (For installation, I referred <a href="https://texwiki.texjp.org/Linux" target="_blank">this web site</a>.)
    </ol>
    Although it is easier to build LaTeX on your Linux, it is harder to create a more comfortable environment. I make
    some notes when I use the LaTeX:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <i>Do not</i> to forget to install "LaTeX Workshop".
        </li>
        <li>
            Font settings
            <ul>
                I am particular about font settings, though most people do not care.
                <li>
                    Download "Font Manager" on your OS.<br>
                    "sudo apt-get install font-manager"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open Font Manager ("font-manager") from your command prompt.
                </li>
            </ul>

            If the latex formatting does not work well, installing "libyaml-tiny-perl" and "libfile-homedir-perl" by "sudo apt-get install libyaml-tiny-perl libfile-homedir-perl" on the terminal.
        </li>
    </ul>

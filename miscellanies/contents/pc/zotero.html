    <h2>My Zotero setup</h2>

    <p>
        Zotero is one of the most important tools that I use. This application does so many things to organize documents, especially the technical papers. To maximize Zotero's potential, I tweak as many options as possible. I will share these settings and I hope some readers will refer to my options and to enjoy his study life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before we explain how to set up Zotero, you will need to download some components from the links below (For extensions, download the xpi file):
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/ja_jp/drive/download/" target="_blank">Google Drive for Windows</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/" target="_blank">Zotero</a>
                (You should also refer <a href="#Added: September 18th, 2024">the prescript</a> that was added on September 18th, 2024, before downloading.)

            </li>

            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Set up for Google Drive</h3>

    <p>
        In my preferences, Google Drive is just as important as Zotero itself. We want to put the Drive folder under the User folder, for example "C:Users/(*folder name*)". (In my case, the folder name is itsuki.miyane. You do not need to copy it, of course). If the folder is not created in this location, you can assign it from the application's preferences. If you need to change the options, you will need to change the folder permissions property from Explorer. Once you have done the above, the Google Drive settings are complete.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="fig/zotero/google_drive.png" width="33%"><br>
        You can change the folder from here. (The settings is not appeared in this picture though.)
    </p>


    <h3>Zotero</h3>

    <p>
        The preliminary phase of the Zotero configuration process requires the creation of an account. This facilitates the synchronization of data across multiple devices, thereby obviating the necessity for repetitive operations on each device. Upon completion of this step, approximately half of the setup process is complete. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyway, before installing add-on's, you should go a preference and sync the account.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the options are not synchronized in this case. Therefore, several images have been included to illustrate the various configurations.
    </p>

        <img src="fig/zotero/zoteropreference2.png" width="50%">
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Uncheck all items in "File Handling" and chose "Open PDFs using" as "System Default".
        </li>
        <li>
            Uncheck "Automatically tag items with keywords and subject headings".
        </li>
        <li>
            Go "Advanced" -> "Files and Folders" and set a base directory as the folder that you want to save the PDF files. (This setting is important when we use ZotFile to synchronize Google Drive.)
        </li>
        I believe the changes to the Zotero preferences mentioned above are sufficient.
    </ul>


    <h3>Important Extensions</h3>

    <p>
        We will now introduce two significant extensions, <i>Better BibTeX</i> and <i>ZotFile</i>, which facilitate enhanced functionality within the Zotero ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will try installing BibTeX first. We have to take following steps:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Open Add-on window (Tools -> Add-on)
            </li>
            <li>
                Click "Install Add-on From File"
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        We can change settings from the preference window. 
    </p>

    <p>      
        <img src="fig/zotero/betterbibtex1.png" width="50%"><br>
        <img src="fig/zotero/betterbibtex2.png" width="50%"><br>
        <img src="fig/zotero/betterbibtex3.png" width="50%">
    </p>

    <ul>
        Open the Zotero preference and go to BetterBibTex preference:
        <li>
            Change the citation key formula as "inspireHep". To activate this, we have to install the <i>zotero-inspire</i> extension.
        </li>
        <li>
            Go "Export" -> "BibTeX" and change the item "Add URLs to BibTeX export" from "no" to "in the url field".
        </li>
        <li>
            Go "Export" -> "Fields" and change the item "Fields to omit from export". The default is blank and we add "file,abstract,month,keywords".
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We will also install <i>zotero-inspire,</i> which allows us to treat the Inspire-HEP citation key. We should install Better BibTeX the same way too. No special settings are needed since this is just an extension.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once Better BibTeX is installed, we will start working on ZotFile. It loads the same way, so I will skip that. To change the ZotFile settings, click "Tool -> ZotFile Preference".
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="fig/zotero/zotfile1.png" width="50%"><br>
        <img src="fig/zotero/zotfile1.png" width="50%">
    </p>

    <ul>
        These are most important settings:
        <li>
            Open the ZotFile Preference and set "Source Folder for Attaching New Files" and "Location of Files" as shown in the first picture above. We should just imitate the figure. We don't use the subfolder for the attachment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Go "Renaming Rules" and change the items "Maximum length of title" and "Maximum number of authors" as 200 and 8, respectively.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We can also change into the Dark mode by adding the add-on. You can download it from <a href="https://github.com/Rosmaninho/Zotero-Dark-Theme" target="_blank">here</a>, and follow the instruction of the repo. I think its explanation is very clear, so I will skip that.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        New version <b>Zotero 7</b> has been released, and its settings are different from the previous version. Moreover, <b>ZotFile</b> extension does not work properly now. Then we should use the previous, Zotero 6, and wait for the update of ZotFile. We can get that version from the same web page.
